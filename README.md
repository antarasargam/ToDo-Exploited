# ToDo-Exploited

The following repository contains multiple software exploits performed on ToDo, a command line C application. 
Using the knowledge of format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities, several attack techniques were used to successfully exploit the application and get complete access (root) of the system.

The list of exploits performed are:

* Information leak or arbitrary read exploit using format string vulnerabilities present in C language.
* Arbitrary write to a particular memory address by exploiting the format string vulnerabilities
* Buffer overflow expoiit 
* Shellcode injection by overflow the buffer using vulnerable C functions like memcpy, strcpy
* Arc injection technique used to overflow the buffer which helped in bypassing stack prevention defense mechanisms deployed on the system. 

The steps to successfully demonstrate an exploit on the application is mentioned under each sub folder under this repository.
